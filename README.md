The Excel Exposer unlocks protected worksheets and any protected/hidden rows/columns.

The only requirement is that you need to be able to open the spreadsheet.  Spreadsheets that are password protected
can't be unlocked with this utility.  But if you can open it, this utility will expose anything that is hidden.
